# 1. Recap

The three weeks plan was for each of us to get fully setup in our repo with a working Unity project. Rather than working directly out of the repo we decided each to prototype within separate Unity projects so no settings or testing messed with our repo. Edwards plan was to learn model/asset creation, and learn to utilize the method we found for cutting up our assets. Jacob was to work on Nav mesh along with getting agents to work with it. Additionally to see if he can integrate VR haptic gloves, and get the 3D AI model working. Ian was to work on the building destruction, and setup the VR rig.

# Tasks Completed

## Description of Tasks Completed

Jacob setup Unity teams and found a 3D printer for making the VR gloves while acquiring various unity assets that can potentially be used in the project. Edward learned the necessary technique for cutting up any model that gets imported into blender for the destruction aspect of the game. Ian setup the Open XR rig with walking and turning, created a destruction wall script using our modified imported models, setup dynamic punching script for punch power, and started the leap functionality.

## Quantifiable Metrics

Each person met once each week for a few hours while maintaining continuous communication through discord group.

Ian wrote roughly 250 lines of code and spending roughly 30+ hours total.

# Successes

## Accomplishments

A. Able to get a variation of the destructible walls concept. Able to get physics implemented with VR Rig, along with proper movement/leaping. Created a dynamic punching script that gauges how hard the user punches. Found and exercised a efficient way to cut up any assets acquired or made. 3D printer reserved for haptic gloves.

## Successful Solution

Creating destructible objects utilizing Unities configurable joints, dynamically, along with making the setup with the click of a button. Integrating Open XR movement components with Unity physics system on the player rig. Applying forces to object punched based off a users punching velocity. Blender asset cutting workflow.

## Things Tried But Didn't Work

For destructible buildings, the configurable joints route didnt seem like the best options since it held the wall chunks together too strongly, but this variation can still be used with any other destructible objects. Tried to install DreamFusion (AI model creator) on CentOS unsuccessfully.

# Roadblocks/Challenges

## Challenges

Edward - I didn't know enough about Blender to create any models. I worked on studying blender through tutorials and documentation and now have a better idea on how to. Since I have mainly been focusing on studying Blender, no models have been made or existing free asset models deconstructed using our cutting method found.

Jacob - I was having trouble finding a low cost method to make the gloves and finding time to work on Nav Mesh. I found a way to print off the parts for the glove by asking our mentor. The challenges I have left are to finish the Nav Mesh and then start working on other parts of the game.

Ian - I didn't know how to originally go about creating destructible object/buildings and getting physics implemented with the VR rig. I started off with a wall that I cut up in blender and was able to create a script that is a viable solution. Additionally, I was able to integrate physics with the Open XR components by alternating between their uses in game which had no side effects. The destructible wall/building method achieved didn't have the most desired effect so am going about the logic a different way in search for a better outcome.

# Changes/Deviation From Plan

Edward plans changed from working on making models, to studying and becoming more proficient in Blender. Jeanne ended up not taking the 2nd semester of the course so we were down a member. Jacob decided to make force feedback gloves with a 3d printer.

# Details Description of Goals/ Plan for â€‹Next 3 Weeks

Jacob will completely finish the Navmesh along with getting walking agents on the Navmesh, work on the code, and get the 3D parts submitted for printing.

Edward will start exporting models, from blender, for our game.

Ian will finalize the destructible walls/buildings and complete the climbing ability and leap ability.

# Confidence

Edward is a 3 on how confident he is about completing the models for the game over the next 3 weeks.

Jacob is a 5 on how confident he is on complete code and 3D printing for the next 3 weeks.

Ian is 4 on how confident he will get each functionality finished and polished.
